									<p class="lead">One of the key purposes of this funding plan is to retain value of crowdsale contributions in a liquidatable and returnable form in inverse ratio to the value added toward the final, functioning Crowd Found Hub.<br></p><p class="lead">The initial bootstrapping phase for funding the Crowd Found Hub Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will be managed by the founding project members over phases that will cover many milestones.  The founding members appreciate the potential value of structured data on the SAFE network, but agree the Ethereum ecosystem provides more than enough features for this phase of development, and should even be able to host the final tokenization system and smart contracts if there should be a problem with SAFE’s development. At this stage of development and funding, all parties who wish to be involved will benefit from the various autonomous functions the Ethereum platform offers. These include smart contract based crowdfunding (auto token creation, ETH API for exchanges) and decentralized open-ledger with transparency of funds, contracts and reward payouts. The values associated with this platform are in alignment with our own. They include privacy and the right to anonymity, non-exclusion, non-aggression, and mutually voluntary participation.<br></p>	
								</div>
							
								<div class="col-sm-6">
									<p class="lead">The Crowd Found Hub Bank is self-governing (Locked Smart Contracts) and not influenced by outside forces: its software operates autonomously and its by-laws are immutably chiseled into the Ethereum blockchain. The Crowd Found Hub Bank has total control of the store of value that will include ETH, PoA physical gold, and DigixGold. Additionally, The Crowd Found Hub Bank is the only Minter of Hub Tokens (HT) after the completion of the crowdsale. Hub Tokens are the only way value (DigixGold) can flow out of The Crowd Found Hub Bank, thus the individual/group/entity with the largest share of risk also has the most assurance of stored value. This also means Hub Tokens (HT) will have an immediate inherent value because it is backed by gold.</p><p class="lead">This bank will be untouched, except to pay storage carrying charges on its contents, from its contents. Thus this bank will retain the bulk of its value over the time of its existence and will not be subject to the high volatility and market manipulation experienced in the crypto-economy.  Ergo, adding additional stability and predictability to project development. </p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm-6">
									<p class="lead">Typical crowdsales require capital investors to hold the majority of risk up front and at the same time this can disincentivise the builders to spend any further sweat equity towards the project because the workers received the entire amount of value up front; any expenditures cuts into received crowdsale funds and often their only source of income from the project. Workers are hesitant to join a project later because they did not receive immediate value of the crowdsale and now are dependant on wage pay (Direct cost to project) for their work provided. Plus, it is also difficult to anticipate the revenue success of a startup project and if the project becomes as successful as a company like Apple then the workers see a disproportionate return on investment (physical work) when compared to capital investors.<br>
									</p>	
								</div>
							
								<div class="col-sm-6">
									<p class="lead">Hub Tokens (HT) keep an elegant balance between risk and reward as well as the balance of power over the project of capital investors and Makers (Workers).  As more work value is created for the project, more stake and DigixGold rewards will be received by the Makers (Workers). Simultaneously, the early capital investors will initially receive the largest monthly DigixGold payouts to their Ethereum wallets holding HT; as well as enjoy the possible increase in HT value as useful features from the Hub are built. If the Makers chose to trade their earned HT (Stake in future reward) for immediate capital, then the capital investor will continue to hold the majority of stake in the project and future rewards.<br></p><p class="lead">The only way DigixGold can be paid out from Crowd Fund Bank is through Hub Token (HT) addresses. This incentivises Makers to complete more story points (work) to gain more stake in the project and DigixGold distributions. Initially, crowdsale backers hold the highest risk since they already provided value (ETH) before the majority of work they backed can be complete. This ensures Makers will not be able to further draw value from community provided funds until agreed work value is put towards the development of Crowd Found Hub beyond Milestone I.  <br></p>

										<p>Feature Ideation<br>Possible future features and stories will first start with Ideations on the Crowd Found Hub forum (http://forum.crowdfoundhub.io. The validity of these features can be ideated upon until a story consensus is reached within https://crowdfoundhub.consider.it . Makers will use a process called Estimation Poker to estimate and assign complexity of each story.<br> </p>
										<p>Story Creation<br>Once consensus is reached within https://crowdfoundhub.consider.it, similar or related stories will be standardized into a Feature Proposal that a Maker Badge Holder will submit to the HubMakerDAO for vetting. Founder Badge Holders are able to directly submit feature proposals to the HubMakerDAO without first doing the vetting vote.&nbsp;</p>

										<p>Valid Feature Proposals by HT Quorum then will be manually created within the Crowd Found Hub Pivotal Tracker project management tool with already designated Stories and Story Points.<br></p>

									<div class="title"><span>Creation, Destruction and Rewarding of Story Point Tokens by HubMakerDAO</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>
											HubMakerDAO creates, distributes, and can also destroy Story Point Tokens (SPT), which is governed by the Founder Badge Holders. A Story point token’s primary purpose is to keep record of work by Makers and distribute received value like newly minted HT from the Crowd Found Hub Bank. The function and/or purpose of SPT’s may change throughout Crowd Found Hub’s development process so the feature of minting and destroying needs to be unlocked and solely controlled by the Founder Badge Holders to ensure the dynamic creative process is agile.

									<div class="title"><span>Hub Token Reward Claiming</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>There will be a window period where story point token holders can submit their claims for rewards to HubMakerDAO every month. Users will send their Story Point Token balance using a proxy address to identify their sending wallet 1:1. Story Point Tokens that are sent will be locked up for the duration of the claiming window to prevent double claims, before being returned together with the rewards from HubMakerDAO. Once the claim window closes, all HT that is collected by HubMakerDAO will be distributed evenly to those who submitted the claim. Hence, if a Story Point Token holder does not participate in the claiming window, the portion unclaimed will be apportioned to those who did.<br></p>

								<h5>HubMakerDAO Agile Development Flow</h5>
								<p>
									The processes described here are described using existing tools. We need a way to run and define our processes before the hub exists. We will learn a ton about what to include and what not to include in the Hub by creating and following a developing process workflow. We will be making modifications to the workflow as lessons are learned. Eventually we will have a strong set of processes that can be turned into actual Hub features. These features will eventually be autonomous functions where appropriate.
